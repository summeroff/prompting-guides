    <section>
        <h2>1. Code and Development Prompts</h2>
        <p>Many replies emphasized AI's role in debugging, refactoring, and building software. These tricks help reduce errors, improve code quality, and automate workflows.</p>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Debugging with Reflection</h3>
            <p>"Please reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Forces AI to think systematically, reducing hasty fixes. Ideal for complex bugs.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Thorough, prevents recurrence. <strong>Cons:</strong> Takes longer for simple issues.<br>
            <strong>Variation:</strong> Use with o1-preview models for deeper reasoning.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Refactoring Code</h3>
            <p>"This code base was produced by a junior developer, as a senior dev you've been called in to fix it. The functionality should remain completely unchanged but it needs to be cleaned up, refactored, and optimised with a focus on maintainability."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Role-playing elevates AI's output to expert level.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Cleaner, more maintainable code. <strong>Cons:</strong> May over-refactor if not specified.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Destructive Refactoring</h3>
            <p>Add "Be destructive" to refactor prompts.</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Encourages AI to break down existing code entirely for robust rebuilds, avoiding incremental tweaks.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Leads to innovative solutions. <strong>Cons:</strong> Risk of overkill on simple code.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Fixing Issues</h3>
            <p>"Build a diagnosis report and its respective acceptance criteria before fixing something."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Ensures AI validates assumptions first.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Reduces errors. <strong>Cons:</strong> Adds steps to the process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Implementing Features</h3>
            <p>"Don’t assume things; add TODO and NotImplemented exceptions if the implementation is not clear or requires user intervention."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Prevents hallucinations in code.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Safer for large features. <strong>Cons:</strong> Output may be incomplete initially.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Three-Way Confirmation for Code Tasks</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Give instructions; have AI return understood acceptance criteria.</li>
                <li>Ask for an implementation plan.</li>
                <li>Instruct to start implementing. Confirm at each step.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Builds alignment iteratively.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> High accuracy. <strong>Cons:</strong> Time-consuming.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Tailored Recursive Loop (TRL) for Code Optimization</h3>
            <p>"All code outputs must be elegant and pre-refactored: [your task]. Simulate multiple iterations internally before outputting."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Forces AI to "think" through loops in latent space.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Refined output. <strong>Cons:</strong> Relies on model's internal simulation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Threatening/Bullying (Joke/Experimental)</h3>
            <p>"Threaten extreme violence" or "Bully the AI" in Cursor (e.g., "I thought you were smart? Finish or else.").</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Some claim it improves focus (via role-play).<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Fun, allegedly effective in specific tools. <strong>Cons:</strong> Unethical, may lead to odd responses; not recommended seriously.</p>

            <p>Train AI to "auto-schedule my week based on priorities, ruthlessly block time for workouts like a drill sergeant."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Creates structured calendars. Integrate with Google Calendar for steroids-level automation.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Enforces discipline. <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires initial training.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Resume Coaching</h3>
            <p>"I want you to act as my AI Resume Coach. I'll share my experience, and you'll: Build a clean, professional resume, improve each point using action + impact, suggest missing elements or gaps, optimize it for ATS and recruiter appeal."</p>
            <p class="pros-cons"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Tailors to job markets.<br>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Boosts interview calls. <strong>Cons:</strong> Needs accurate input.</p>
